# Climate Impact Analyzer

## Overview
Climate Impact Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and visualize the effects of climate change. It leverages various data processing libraries and integrates with Streamlit for interactive data presentation.

## Features
- Data Import: Support for various file formats including CSV, JSON, and potentially OGR-compatible geospatial data.
- Data Processing: Utilizes libraries like Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.
- Visualization: Creates interactive charts and graphs using Streamlit.
- AI-Powered Analysis: Integrates with OpenAI for advanced data interpretation (if applicable).
- Geospatial Analysis: Potential support for geospatial data processing (based on the presence of GDAL/OGR related code).

## Installation
To install Climate Impact Analyzer, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then run:


Data Handling
The tool supports various data formats:

CSV and JSON through Pandas
Potential support for geospatial data formats through OGR
Streamlit Integration
The project leverages Streamlit for creating interactive web applications. Streamlit's write() function is extensively used for displaying various types of data:

Markdown text
Data frames
Charts (Matplotlib, Altair, Plotly, Bokeh)
Images
JSON data
Advanced Features
Potential support for handling large datasets through efficient data processing techniques.
Possible integration with machine learning models for predictive analysis.
Support for streaming data output, which could be useful for real-time data processing.
Dependencies
Streamlit
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Altair
Plotly
Bokeh
GDAL/OGR (for geospatial data handling, if implemented)
OpenAI (if AI interpretation is implemented)
